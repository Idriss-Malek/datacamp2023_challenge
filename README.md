## Getting started

### Install

To run a submission and the notebook you will need the dependencies listed
in `requirements.txt`. One can install the dependencies with the
following command-line:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using `conda`, we provide an `environment.yml` file for similar
usage.

### Challenge description

Get started on this RAMP with the
[dedicated notebook](starting_notebook.ipynb).


The objective of this study is to predict the probability of property fair visitors booking a property. This involves exploring a dataset comprising visitor information and their booking behavior at property fairs. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of a visitor booking a property based on various features provided in the dataset.


### Test a submission

The submissions need to be located in the `submissions` folder. For instance
for `my_submission`, it should be located in `submissions/starkint_kit`.

To run a specific submission, you can use the `ramp-test` command line:

```bash
ramp-test --submission starting-kit
```

You can get more information regarding this command line:

```bash
ramp-test --help
```

### To go further
