## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

To run a submission and the notebook, ensure you have the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

If you're using `conda`, you can use the provided `environment.yml` file for similar setup.

### Challenge Description

Get started with this RAMP using the dedicated notebook provided in `starting_notebook.ipynb`.

The objective of this study is to predict the probability of property fair visitors booking a property. The dataset comprises visitor information and their booking behavior at property fairs. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of a visitor booking a property based on various features provided in the dataset.

### Test a Submission

All submissions should be located in the `submissions` folder. For instance, for a submission named `starting-kit`, it should be located in `submissions/starting-kit`.

To run a specific submission, you can use the `ramp-test` command line:

```bash
ramp-test --submission starting-kit
```

For more information on using the `ramp-test` command, you can refer to the help documentation:

```bash
ramp-test --help
```

### Further Information
